### Task-01: Population Data Visualization

**Internship:** Data Science Internship – Prodigy InfoTech

---

### Objective
To visualize the distribution of a continuous and categorical variable using histogram and bar chart.

---

### Dataset
**Source:** World Population Dataset (Kaggle)  
**Description:** Country-wise population statistics across multiple years.

---

### Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

### Visualizations
1. **Histogram – Population Distribution (2020)**  
   Visualizes how population values are distributed across countries.

2. **Bar Chart – Top 10 Most Populated Countries (2020)**  
   Highlights countries contributing most to the global population.

---

### Key Insights
- The population distribution is highly right-skewed, indicating that most countries have relatively smaller populations.  
- A small number of countries contribute disproportionately to the global population.  
- China and India dominate global population figures, followed by a significant gap among other countries.

---

### Conclusion
This task demonstrates basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) using real-world data and highlights the importance of visualization in understanding data patterns.
